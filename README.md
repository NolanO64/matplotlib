## Coverage measurement


### Existing tool


The tool we use to perform coverage analysis is `Coverage.py`.


**Execution:**


```sh
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
```

## Coverage improvement


### Individual tests


<The following is supposed to be repeated for each group member>


<Group member name>


<Test 1>


<Show a patch (diff) or a link to a commit made in your forked repository that shows the new/enhanced test>


<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results (the same as you already showed above)>


<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results>


<State the coverage improvement with a number and elaborate on why the coverage is improved>


<Test 2>


<Provide the same kind of information provided for Test 1>


### Overall


<Provide a screenshot of the old coverage results by running an existing tool (the same as you already showed above)>


<Provide a screenshot of the new coverage results by running the existing tool using all test modifications made by the group>


## Statement of individual contributions


<Write what each group member did>
